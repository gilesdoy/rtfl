<h3>FAQs</h3>
<h4><p><b>1) What happens if a player withdraws?</b><br>
-Players that withdraw once the deadline has closed (and the event is underway) will earn points respective to where they started the event.<br>
-For players that withdraw before the deadline: I will endeavour to refresh the available selections in time but that cannot be guaranteed.</p>
<p><b>2) What if I miss the deadline for an event?</b><br>
The deadlines for squad selections are hard-coded into the game. You will not be able to enter or edit squad selections after that deadline.<br>
If you did not select any players in your squad, the game will randomly auto-pick three players for you (subject to budget being available.) Auto-picks will be added after the conclusion of the event. You will not earn any bonuses from an auto-picked squad selection. The 'Solo Pick' bonus will not apply to auto-picks.</p>
<p><b>3) How do I select my squad for future events?</b><br>
The website is not currently set up to allow future events. Some events are very close to each other - less than a week in some cases. In that situation, the website will reopen for squad selections on the evening of the last day of the previous event.</p>
<p><b>4) I can't submit my squad - the button is missing!</b><br>
That's because you're over budget! Change your squad or leave selections as 'None'.</p>
<p><b>5) What if I miss the start of the season?</b><br>
If you start mid-season, you will have previous events auto-picked for you (see above) and you will start with what's remaining of your budget.</p>
<p><b>6) Can I pick the same player multiple times in one event?</b><br>
Yes! You can double-pick a player but you can't triple-pick a player this season.</p>
<p><b>7) What about qualifying, doubles and satellite events?</b><br>
They're all included this season. You'll earn points for results of qualifying matches, and bonuses for performance in doubles events. (See Rules for more detail)</p>
<p><b>8) I can't see my boost button?</b><br>
That will be because you have used it in a previous event. You can only use your boost once.</p>
<p><b>9) I don't want to pick any players for an event (because I want to save some of my budget.) Will I have a squad auto-picked for me?</b><br>
<u>Yes, you will.</u> If you do not make any selections for an event you will be subject to the auto-pick procedure. To avoid having auto-picks applied, you should select "Skip Round" from the drop-down menus.</p>
<p><b>10) How does the auto-pick function work?</b><br>
The auto-pick function checks whether your squad selection for an event is all "None". If so, it looks at all the players taking part in a tournament and randomly selects three of them (with replacement). It adds up the prices for those players, and checks whether you have budget to buy those players for your squad. (If you don't, it goes back and randomly selects three different players.) If you do, it deducts the prices from your budget and adds the points those players accrue to your points total.<br>
Note: auto-picked players do not earn any bonus points.</p>
