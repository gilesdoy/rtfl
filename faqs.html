<h4><b>1) What happens if a player withdraws?</b><br>
-Players that withdraw once the deadline has closed (and the event is underway) will earn points respective to where they started the event.<br>
-For players that withdraw before the deadline: I will endeavour to refresh the available selections in time but that cannot be guaranteed.<p>
<b>2) What if I miss the deadline for an event?</b><br>
The deadlines for squad selections are hard-coded into the game. You will not be able to enter or edit squad selections after that deadline.<br>
If you did not select any players in your squad, the game will randomly auto-pick three players for you (subject to budget being available.) Auto-picks will be added after the conclusion of the event. You will not earn any bonuses from an auto-picked squad selection. The 'Solo Pick' bonus will not apply to auto-picks.<p>
<b>3) How do I select my squad for future events?</b><br>
The website is not currently set up to allow future events. Some events are very close to each other - less than a week in some cases. In that situation, the website will reopen for squad selections on the evening of the last day of the previous event.<p>
<b>4) I can't submit my squad - the button is missing!</b><br>
That's because you're over budget! Change your squad or leave selections as 'None'.<p>
<b>5) I've forgotten my password!</b><br>
Contact me and I can reset it for you. Please email <a href="mailto:cortstats@gmail.com">cortstats@gmail.com</a> or message me through social media. Please bear in mind password resets are not instant!<p>
<b>6) What if I miss the start of the season?</b><br>
If you start mid-season, you will have previous events auto-picked for you (see above) and you will start with what's remaining of your budget.<p>
<b>7) Can I pick the same player multiple times in one event?</b><br>
Yes, you can! It's a high risk strategy, and you'll get no sympathy if your player loses 0/6, 1/6, 0/6 in their first round match.<p>
<b>8) What about qualifying, doubles and satellite events?</b><br>
This game ignores those matches, and focuses solely on the Singles Main Draw event. Women's Open tournaments are currently not included in the League, but may be included in future years.<p>
