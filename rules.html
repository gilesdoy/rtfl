<h3>Introduction</h3>  
<p>In this game you will play the role of an enforcement team enforcing regulations on the imports of Timber and Timber products to the UK.
The game will present you with information on 180 consignments of timber, divided into six weeks of 30 consignments each.</p>
<p>Your job is to identify which consignments should be set aside for a document check.</p>
<p>Click on the banners below for more details.</p>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Costs</button>
<div class="content">
  <h3>Costs</h3>
  Enforcement activity is not free though, and you will incur costs from your work. The general principle of your costs are:
  <p><center><b>More checks will cost disproportionately more money.</b></center></p>
  <h4>Labour costs</h4>
  You'll need to pay people to inspect consignments at the ports of entry:
  <ul>
    <li>The first 10 consignments you check each week will cost £2,000 each.</li>
    <li>The next 10 consignments will cost £2,500 each.</li>
    <li>The last 10 consignments will cost £5,000 each.</li>
  </ul>
  These costs increase by 50% in weeks 3 and 4 of the game (i.e. £3,000/£3,750/£7,500).
  In weeks 5 and 6 they are doubled (i.e. £4,000/£5,000/£10,000)
  <h4>Translation services</h4>
  Consignments whose paperwork is not written in English will need to be sent off for translation. This will cost <b>an additional £500</b> per consignment.
  <h4>Travel costs to Immingham</h4>
  <p>Some consignments enter the UK through Immingham port. Since your team is primarily based in SE England, you will incur more costs for travel and accommodation in Immingham. This will cost <b>an additional £300</b> per consignment you inspect.</p>
  <p><b>A useful tip: the game will calculate your costs as you go along. And while there is no budget constraint,</b> you should keep an eye on your spending!</p>
</div>
<p></p>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Benefits</button>
<div class="content">
  <h3>Benefits</h3>
  Research into the detriment that's avoided from not having non-compliant timber on the UK market estimates the <b>economic benefit to be 10p per tonne of seized timber</b>. As before <b>the game will calculate your benefits as you go along.</b>
</div>
<p></p>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Playing the Game</button>
<div class="content">
<h3>Playing the game</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Select your team number on the left-hand side and enter your password (provided to you).</li>
  <li>Select the consignments you wish to inspect by ticking the boxes next to their ID. These will appear on the main panel of the screen.</li>
  <li>When you are ready, click the green <u>Send Consignments for Checks</u> button.</li>
  <li>The results of your checks will show in the panel below, and the game skips on to the next week.</li>
  <li>After Week 6, the green "Send" button disappears and you should move to the "Quiz" tab at the top of the screen.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p></p>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">The Joker</button>
<div class="content">
<h3>The Joker</h3>
<p>When playing across multiple tables, you can play a Joker to see what enforcement activity (and results) another team has conducted. Follow the instructions under "The Joker" tab.</p>
<p>You may only play your Joker once in the game, and <b>playing your Joker will cost you £35,000</b></p>
</div>
<p></p>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">How to win</button>
<div class="content">
Here's the big clue:
<h4><center>The characteristics of non-compliant consignments does not change during the game. Use the results from the previous weeks’ enforcement activity to spot patterns and guide your decision making.</h4></center>
</div>
<p></p>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Finding a winner</button>
<div class="content">
<p>A high-performing team is one that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Achieves a <b>Benefit:Cost ratio greater than 6</b> (that is, add up all your costs, add up all your benefits, divide one by the other) at the end of the game.</li>
  <li>Achieves <b>Total Benefits exceeding £1.5m</b> over the six weeks of the game.</li>
  <li>Scores full marks in the Quiz</li>
</ul>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Caveats</button>
<div class="content">
<h3>Caveats and health warnings</h3>
<ol>
  <li>This game uses data from HMRC's UKTradeInfo website, filtered for products likely to be within scope of EU Timber Regulations. This means the data <b>is representative of</b> the UK's general imports for Timber and Timber products, in that</li>
  <ul>
    <li>The ports of entry used in the game are generally the ones which Timber and Timber products pass through</li>
    <li>The countries used in the game are generally the ones the UK imports Timber and Timber products through</li>
    <li>The overall figures for total weight and total value of timber are broadly equivalent to the UK weekly average.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Data on product categories, language and supplier status are randomly made up by the game and are not based on any data.</li>
  <li><b>There is no data to substantiate a correlation between the characteristics of non-compliant consignments, and those seen in real life.</b> Any relationship is purely coincidental and this game does not use any sensitive information.</li>
