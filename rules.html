<!--- <button type="button" class="collapsible">Injuries and withdrawals</button> --->
<h3>Injuries and Withdrawals</h3>
  <h4><b>Before the tournament starts</b><br>
  Players who withdraw before the deadline will earn zero points. Players are responsible for ensuring all members of their squad can play.<p>
  <b>During the tournament</b><br>
  Squad selections cannot be changed during a tournament; therefore injuries and withdrawals during an event will attract points in the same way that that player would have earned if they were fully fit.
